# P4AllBuildingBlocks
This repository contains configuration files for deploying dedicated AsTeRICS Building Blocks, and runnable stand-alone demos for their application. A dedicated deployment tool has been developed for the [Prosperity For All project (P4All)](http://www.prosperity4all.eu/
). For more information about customisation of Building Blocks and deployments as well as licensing options please have a look a the [Wiki](https://github.com/asterics/P4AllBuildingBlocks/wiki)

The current version of the repository includes configurations files for following Building Blocks:
* Bioelectric Signal Acquisition: OpenEEG
* Bioelectric Signal Acquisition: OpenBCI
* Digital Signal Processing: IIRFilter
* Computer Vision (Camera Input): FaceTrackerLK
* Computer Vision (Camera Input): XFaceTrackerLK
* Computer Vision (Eye Tacking): TobiiEyeX
* Microcontroller (Input Transducer): Arduino
* Microcontroller (HID emulation): Universal HID Actuator
* Network I/O Building Block: WebSocket
* Smart Home Integration: KNX
